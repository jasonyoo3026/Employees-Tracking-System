# MySQL: Employee Tracker

## Introduction

This program was designed to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The inspiration to build this program was that developers are required to create interfaces that allow non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases and these interfaces are referred as content management systems (CMS)

## Installation

In order to run this program, the users will be required to use the `Inquirer` package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.

Also the users need to use the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line, and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.

To create a database, please run schema.sql and seeds.sql in the "db" directory.
```
source schema.sql

source seeds.sql

```
